# OverFitting-UnderFitting-Lasso-Ridge-Regression
ðŸ“š Overfitting, Underfitting, Lasso &amp; Ridge Regression ðŸš€ This project explores Overfitting (high variance) and Underfitting (high bias) in machine learning. Lasso Regression (L1) reduces overfitting by eliminating irrelevant features, while Ridge Regression (L2) shrinks coefficients. Both techniques enhance model generalization and performance.
